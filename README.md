J. Bhatia, A. Dayal et al., "Object Classification Technique for mmWave FMCW Radars using Range-FFT Features," 2021 International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS (COMSNETS), Bangalore, India, 2021, pp. 111-115, doi: 10.1109/COMSNETS51098.2021.9352894.

In this project we classify the objects based on the features extracted from range FFT from mmWave radar. 
## Dataset
The dataset is private. For the dataset please contact me.
### Description 
1. Total samples: 226
2. Total classes: 3 ( Car, Drone, Human)
3. Total no. of features: 5 ( Distance, Area, Height, Width, Standard Deviation)
